# text to music Infrastructure Project

This project aims to provision and manage infrastructure on AWS using Terraform.

## Overview

This Terraform project automates the provisioning of infrastructure components such as virtual machines, networking configurations, storage resources, and more on the AWS cloud platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

You'll also need valid AWS credentials configured locally to authenticate with AWS services.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Johan794/text-to-music-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd text-to-music-infra
    ```

3. Initialize Terraform:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

4. Review and customize the `terraform.tfvars` file to configure variables specific to your AWS environment.

5. Deploy the infrastructure:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

6. Confirm the changes and proceed with applying the Terraform configuration.

## Usage

This project provides a modular and scalable approach to managing AWS infrastructure. You can customize and extend the Terraform configurations to suit your specific requirements.

### Folder Structure

- `main.tf`: Contains the main Terraform configuration defining AWS resources.
- `variables.tf`: Declares input variables used in the Terraform configuration.
- `outputs.tf`: Defines output values to display after applying the Terraform configuration.
- `terraform.tfvars`: Stores variable values (not committed to version control).
- `modules/`: Directory containing reusable Terraform modules for different AWS resources.
